# Requirement and High-level Design for Music Recommendation Project
***


**1. High-Level Description of the Project:**

- Provide a platform to recommend music to the user based on genre, band, instrumentation, tempo, key, and other musical parameters and previous music choices or saved preferences. 
- Users can keep some metrics or search results, so they never miss a song or recommendation. 


**2. Why should the stakeholder invest in this project?**

- While other major music streaming platforms are available, no other application uses instrumentation, time signatures, tempo, key, and song length to filter, suggest, and search for music choices. 
- The significant advantage of this application is the granularity of the search available to the users. 


**3. Type of users:** 

   - _Primary users:_
     - Musicians, music students, or people with deep music interests and knowledge seeking specific attributes in songs, albums, bands, or genres.
   - _Secondary Users:_ 
     - Any people who enjoy music.
     

**4. Major capabilities of the platform:**

   - A filtered search allows the user to search based on the generic song, album, genre, or filter by instrumentation, time signatures, tempo, key, and song length.
   - History to see recent searches and additional metrics on the users’ preferences and search habits. The history would display the most popular selections of each category.


**5. Listing of individuals on the team along with their assigned roles**
   - _Project Manager_: Matthew Mercado
   - _Requirement Analyst_: Maggie Curtis, Takesa Gambrell
   - _Data Engineer_: Andrew Emmons, Fattah Animashaun
   - _Software Engineer_: Jarrod Stebick, Matt LeRoux
   - _Test Engineer_: Peyton Howard, Quddus (DJ) Akim-Shittu
   - _Deployment Engineer_: Hung Pham
   

**6. REAM requirements**
   - **Reliable**: Holds more than one user at a time; reliably finds music recommendations that match search parameters. Users can do multiple searches for those longer jamming sessions.
   - **Effective**: It recommends music effectively based on the user's preferences. More specifically, the quality of the search results will be adequately accurate.
   - **Adaptable**: It adapts as more information about the user is collected over time, and new data is able to be reliably stored about each user. 
   - **Maintainable**: Modifies the user interface that matches the user’s need to enhance their experience. Adds new music is included in relevant search results.
   

**7. Use Case Scenarios**

   - New users open the app for the first time and create a new account.

   - New user selects Guest login to search music quickly without saving their search history.

   - Logged in user reviews search history or reset history.

   - Existing users log in to the app by typing usernames and passwords.         

   - Logged-in user selects filters from the drop-down on the search page and views results.

   - Logged-in user resets filters and selects different filters to view different results.
